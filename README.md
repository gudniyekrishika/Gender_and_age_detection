Age and Gender Detection
A Python-based application for real-time age and gender detection from webcam video feed using OpenCV and pre-trained Caffe models. This project leverages Haar Cascade for face detection and deep learning models for predicting age and gender, displaying results on the video stream.
Project Overview
This project implements a real-time age and gender detection system using a webcam. It detects faces in video frames using the Haar Cascade classifier and predicts the age and gender of detected faces using pre-trained Caffe models. The system is designed for applications in human-computer interaction, demographic analysis, and more.
Key features:

Detects faces in real-time using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier.
Predicts gender (Male/Female) and age range (e.g., 0-2, 4-6, ..., 60-100) using pre-trained Caffe models.
Displays bounding boxes and labels on detected faces in the video feed.
Lightweight and easy to set up for real-time processing.

Technology Stack
Programming Language

Python: Core language for implementing the detection pipeline.

Libraries

OpenCV (cv2): For face detection, image processing, and video capture.
NumPy: For numerical operations and data handling.

Models

Haar Cascade Classifier: Pre-trained model for face detection (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml).
Caffe Models:
Age Detection: age_deploy.prototxt and age_net.caffemodel (predicts 8 age ranges).
Gender Detection: gender_deploy.prototxt and gender_net.caffemodel (predicts Male/Female).



Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
A webcam connected to your system
Pre-trained Caffe model files (age_net.caffemodel, gender_net.caffemodel)
OpenCV with DNN module support

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/age-gender-detection.git
cd age-gender-detection


Install Python DependenciesCreate a virtual environment and install the required packages:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Sample requirements.txt:
opencv-python==4.8.0
numpy==1.24.3


Download Pre-trained Models

Download the pre-trained Caffe models (age_net.caffemodel, gender_net.caffemodel) from a reliable source (e.g., OpenCV model zoo or other repositories).
Place the model files (age_net.caffemodel, gender_net.caffemodel) and configuration files (age_deploy.prototxt, gender_deploy.prototxt) in the project directory or update the paths in age_gender_dect.py to point to their location.


Verify Haar Cascade File

Ensure the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file is accessible. It is typically included with OpenCV (cv.data.haarcascades).


Run the ApplicationStart the detection script:
python age_gender_dect.py


The webcam will open, and the system will display detected faces with age and gender labels.
Press q to exit the application.



Usage

Run the Script

Execute python age_gender_dect.py to start the webcam feed.
The system will detect faces in real-time and display bounding boxes with labels indicating the predicted gender (Male/Female) and age range (e.g., 0-2, 4-6, etc.).


Interact with the Application

Ensure proper lighting and face visibility for accurate detection.
Press q to stop the video feed and close the application.


Output

Each detected face is outlined with a green rectangle.
A label above the face displays the predicted gender and age range (e.g., "Male, (25-32)").

Model Details
Age Detection Model

Architecture: CaffeNet with 8 output classes corresponding to age ranges: (0-2), (4-6), (8-12), (15-20), (25-32), (38-43), (48-53), (60-100).
Input: 227x227 RGB images.
Output: Probability distribution over 8 age buckets.

Gender Detection Model

Architecture: CaffeNet with 2 output classes (Male, Female).
Input: 227x227 RGB images.
Output: Probability distribution over 2 gender classes.

Face Detection

Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) for detecting faces in the video feed.

Limitations

Accuracy: Depends on lighting, face orientation, and image quality. Poor lighting or occlusions may reduce performance.
Model Specificity: The pre-trained models may not generalize well to all demographics or ethnicities.
Webcam Dependency: Requires a functioning webcam and sufficient computational resources for real-time processing.

Future Enhancements

Improved Face Detection: Integrate Mediapipe for more robust face detection (as shown in the commented code).
Model Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the Caffe models on diverse datasets for better accuracy.
Multi-Face Handling: Enhance the system to handle multiple faces more efficiently.
GUI Integration: Develop a user-friendly interface using Tkinter or PyQt for easier interaction.
Mobile Support: Extend the application to work on mobile devices with camera input.
